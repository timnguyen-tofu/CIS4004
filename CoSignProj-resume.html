          Some of the skills that we aquired during this project include: learning ReactJS for
          front-end web development, integrating Google Cloud AI and OpenAI APIs for
          document processing and natural language understanding, and project management

          This was the first project where I led a team, so I also learned valuable leadership
          and communication skills to effectively guide team members and collaborate towards
          our common goals.
